# Catalog And Products

## Current Picture

The 49 legacy products were moved to Draft on 2026-07-23. The replacement is an
owned fifteen-product wall-art collection. All fifteen Shopify records are
Active, available for sale, visible through the configured production
Storefront API, and mapped to Prodigi. Activation did not resolve the failed
Standard-shipping cost gate, missing Prodigi billing, or missing physical
samples.

The storefront no longer uses an email-only early-access CTA. All 15 previews
now resolve to the Active products and the existing product, cart, and checkout
path. A Draft or unpublished handle would remain a non-interactive preview.

## Original Art Replacement

| Capsule         | Product handles                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quiet Form      | `quiet-form-i-art-print`, `quiet-form-ii-art-print`, `quiet-form-iii-art-print`                |
| Patina Blue     | `patina-blue-i-art-print`, `patina-blue-ii-art-print`, `patina-blue-iii-art-print`             |
| Neo Deco        | `neo-deco-i-art-print`, `neo-deco-ii-art-print`, `neo-deco-iii-art-print`                      |
| Midnight Garden | `midnight-garden-i-art-print`, `midnight-garden-ii-art-print`, `midnight-garden-iii-art-print` |
| Sunlit Mosaic   | `sunlit-mosaic-i-art-print`, `sunlit-mosaic-ii-art-print`, `sunlit-mosaic-iii-art-print`       |

Each live product has one 8 × 10 inch variant with a base price of EUR 29.
Shopify Markets presents a contextual USD 34 price to the US storefront.
Larger formats are blocked until higher-resolution production and sample
review. Source metadata is in `data/original-art-catalog.json`; the mutating
`scripts/sync-original-art-catalog.mjs` remains a Draft staging command and must
not be run as a way to preserve the current Active state.

`data/art-product-extensions.json` and
`scripts/prepare-art-product-extensions.py` define twelve additional product
families and generate local Prodigi production candidates plus committed review
previews. `scripts/sync-art-product-extensions.mjs` is dry-run by default and
creates or updates the Shopify records as **DRAFT** only after an explicit
`--apply`. SKU, shipping, margin, and physical-sample gates still apply.
All twelve records, totalling 71 variants, were created and passed live Shopify
readback on 2026-07-24; none were published.

## Catalog Filtering

`app/lib/catalogFilters.ts` uses an explicit fifteen-handle launch allowlist.
Old or supplier-imported products cannot appear in catalog, search,
recommendations, or direct product routes merely because they are active in
Shopify. Admin status is still the authoritative cross-channel control. The
intended state is now 15 Active originals, 12 Draft extensions, and 49 Draft
legacy products.

It defines:

- Five original-art capsule previews.
- Legacy/off-theme collection handles, including empty home-goods navigation
  left by the previous catalog.
- Off-theme product handles.
- Unfulfillable product handles.
- The fifteen approved original-art product handles.
- Home-goods terms.
- Off-theme vendor and product terms.
- `isStoreThemeProduct`.
- `filterDemoProducts`.
- `filterDemoCollections`.

This filtering is used by home, collection, product, and search routes.

## Storefront Product Behavior

Product cards use `ClaraProductCard` and product-card fragments to display
storefront product data consistently. Product pages add:

- Variant option selection.
- Add-to-cart analytics.
- Shopify ProductView analytics.
- Ad platform product view event.
- JSON-LD product schema.
- Recently viewed persistence.
- Shop Pay button when available.

`app/lib/productCardFragment.ts`, `app/routes/products.$handle.tsx`.

## Admin Cleanup Relationship

The code filters off-theme products defensively, but the Admin cleanup document
says unwanted products and collections should be cleaned at the Shopify source
so they cannot leak into search, feeds, SEO, or future storefront routes.
