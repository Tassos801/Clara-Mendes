# Artist-shop pilot status

**Updated:** 2026-10-09  
**Branch:** `codex/artist-shops-pilot`  
**State:** In progress; no production release  
**Current writer:** Claude Code (owner's primary PC), from 2026-10-09 ~16:00.
The Codex/Sol session hit its usage limit after the docs commit; none of its
in-progress build work was saved.

## Completed

- Agreed brief uploaded into the repository.
- Isolated branch/worktree created from current main `f4ac0f2`.
- Root agent instructions, README and wiki link to the cross-PC handoff.
- Baseline on `76f829e` (Node 24.12.0): `npm test` 379/379 pass,
  `npm run typecheck` exit 0, `npm run lint` exit 0; CI Validate + Oxygen
  preview passed on the branch push.
- Baseline findings:
  - Current main uses mixed legacy release gates, so an artist-page-only
    visibility change would be incomplete.
  - Print-catalog prints are gated by `released: true` in
    `data/print-catalog.json` plus Shopify Active/publication
    (`computeSellableHandles`). Museum prints should use that same gate.
  - The print pipeline assumes 4:5 portrait sources and crops to fit
    (`scripts/prepare-print-assets.py` rejects other ratios). It also tags every
    print `Clara Mendes Original` and `4:5 Ratio` and calls it a "portrait print"
    (`scripts/lib/product-pipeline.mjs`). Museum reproductions need full-composition
    bordered layouts and different copy and tags.
  - Met and AIC open-access APIs are reachable from this PC (checked with
    Hokusai's Great Wave, Met 45434 / AIC 24645).

- **Milestone 1: registry and Met sourcing (local only, no Shopify).**
  - `data/art-registry.json` plus `app/lib/artRegistry.ts`: artists and
    artworks with stable ids, owner approval for artists, separate
    rights/master reviews with who and when, a rights screen (object-level
    public-domain flag, life + 70 by year, attribution match, no qualified
    attributions) and a validator.
  - `npm run museum -- status | search | fetch | qualify`
    (`scripts/museum.mjs`, `scripts/lib/museum-met.mjs`). Raw Met records
    are committed under `data/museum-evidence/` with their sha256; originals
    are cached under `<launchDir>/museum/originals/` and re-fetchable.
    `review` and `approve-artist` record owner decisions only.
  - `scripts/lib/museum-layout.mjs`: full-composition layouts on white paper
    in the artwork's orientation. Verdicts: ≥300 ppi qualified, 150–299 needs
    an owner exception, <150 unsupported.
  - Artists registered (all unapproved): Katsushika Hokusai, Utagawa
    Hiroshige, Clara Mendes Studio.
  - First artwork end to end: `met-45434` The Great Wave. The original is
    3859×2594. The rights screen passes, and the owner rights and master
    reviews are pending. It qualifies for 8×10 only (427 ppi); 16×20 is
    213 ppi and 20×24 is 179 ppi, so both need an exception.
  - Tests: `scripts/museumArt.node-test.mjs` (13).
- API facts (2026-10-09): Met `/v1/search` was retired 2026-10-01; use
  `/v1.1/search` (offset/limit, max 500 per page, first 10,000 results only).
  The Met website returns 429 to scripts, but its API does not. AIC's API
  JSON works, but its IIIF image server serves a Cloudflare bot challenge
  (403) to scripts, so AIC is not used for images and the challenge must not
  be bypassed.

## Current work

- Link print-catalog entries to artworks/artists (museum collections) with
  bordered full-composition print files and museum-appropriate copy and tags.
- Artist browsing (`/artists`, `/artists/<slug>`) derived from the same
  print-catalog records and release gate.

## Next checkpoint

Record exact implementation, tests, open issues and the next task here before
ending this session.

## Not done

- No museum collection has been selected or cleared for sale.
- No artist metaobjects or new products have been created in Shopify.
- Artist browsing, production files, galleries, supplier mapping and pilot
  launch remain to be implemented/verified.
- No production deploy, supplier order, payment or public marketing action.
